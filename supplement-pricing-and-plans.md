## 💰 Understanding Credits

### What Are Credits?

**Credits** are Lovable's currency for using AI features. Different actions cost different amounts of credits.

### Credit Costs

| Action | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Chat Mode message** | 1 credit | Per message/question |
| **Agent Mode (simple)** | < 1 credit | Simple tasks cost less |
| **Agent Mode (complex)** | 1-5+ credits | Complex tasks cost more |
| **Code viewing** | Free | Viewing code costs nothing |
| **Code editing** | Included in paid plans | Free plan: view only |

### How Credits Work

- **Free plan:** You get a monthly credit allowance
- **Paid plans:** Higher credit allowances
- **Usage varies:** Simple tasks cost less, complex tasks cost more
- **Credits reset:** Monthly allowance refreshes each month

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Most simple tasks cost very little. You can build a lot with the free plan!
