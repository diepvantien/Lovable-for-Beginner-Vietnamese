1. Look at your project preview (the right side of the screen)
2. Look for a **"Visual Edit"** button or icon (usually near the preview)
3. Click it to activate Visual Edit Mode
4. Your preview will enter edit mode

**What you'll see:** Elements on your page become clickable and editable.

#### Step 2: Click on What You Want to Change

1. **Hover over elements** - You'll see them highlight
2. **Click on text** - It becomes editable
3. **Click on sections** - You can modify them
4. **Click on colors** - You can change them

#### Step 3: Make Your Changes

**For Text:**
- Click on any text

## 📖 Lesson 2: Adding Custom Knowledge

### What is Custom Knowledge?

**Custom Knowledge** lets you teach Lovable specific information about your project, brand, or preferences. It's like giving Lovable a reference guide so it understands your context better.

### Why Add Custom Knowledge?

- **Consistency** - Lovable will use your brand colors, fonts, and style
- **Context** - Lovable understands your business, goals, and audience
- **Efficiency** - You don't have to repeat information in every prompt
- **Accuracy** - Lovable builds things that match your needs better

### What Can You Add as Custom Knowledge?

- **Brand information** - Company name, mission, values
- **Design preferences** - Colors, fonts, style guidelines
- **Content guidelines** - Tone of voice, writing style
- **Technical requirements** - Specific features, integrations
- **User information** - Target audience, use cases

### How to Add Custom Knowledge

#### Step 1: Find the Custom Knowledge Section

1. Look for **"Settings"** or **"Project Settings"** (usually in the top menu or sidebar)
2. Click on it
3. Look for **"Custom Knowledge"** or **"Project Knowledge"** section
4. Click to open it

#### Step 2: Add Your Information

You can add information in several ways:

**Option A: Type It In**
1. Click "Add Knowledge" or similar button

3. Lovable will read and understand it

**Option C: Paste Text**
1. Copy text from anywhere
2. Paste it into the knowledge section
3. Save it

#### Step 3: Organize Your Knowledge

You can organize knowledge into categories:
- **Brand Guidelines**
- **Design System**
- **Content Guidelines**
- **Technical Specs**
- **User Stories**

#### Example Custom Knowledge

```
Brand: Coffee Corner
Colors: Warm brown (#8B4513), cream (#FFF8DC), gold (#FFD700)
Font: Modern, friendly, readable
Tone: Welcoming, cozy, community-focused
Target Audience: Coffee lovers, remote workers, students
Mission: Create a welcoming space for everyone to enjoy great coffee
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Start simple! Add basic brand info first, then add more details as you go.

## 📖 Lesson 3: Reverting Changes - Undo Mistakes

### What is Reverting?

**Reverting** means going back to a previous version of your project. It's like the "undo" button, but for your entire project or specific changes.

### When to Revert

You might want to revert when:
- ❌ A change didn't work out as expected
- ❌ You made a mistake
- ❌ You want to try a different approach
- ❌ Something broke after a change
- ❌ You preferred the previous version

### How to Revert Changes

#### Step 1: Find the History

1. Look for **"History"** or **"Version History"** (usually in the menu or sidebar)
2. Click on it
3. You'll see a list of all changes made to your project

**💡 Tip:** You can also ask Lovable: "Show me the project history" or "What changes have I made?"

#### Step 2: View Previous Versions

1. **See the timeline** - Changes are listed chronologically (most recent first)
2. **Preview versions** - Click on a previous version to see what it looked like
3. **Read descriptions** - Each version shows what was changed
4. **Compare versions** - See what's different between versions

#### Step 3: Revert to a Previous Version

**Method 1: Revert from History**
1. **Find the version** you want to go back to
2. **Preview it** - Make sure it's the right one
3. **Click "Revert"** or "Restore" button
4. **Confirm** - You'll be asked to confirm
5. **Your project reverts** - It goes back to that version

**Method 2: Ask to Revert**
```
Revert to the version before I added the navigation menu
```

or

```
Go back to yesterday's version
```

or

```
Undo the last change I made
```

#### Step 4: Edit Messages to Revert (Alternative Method)

You can also revert by editing your message:

1. **Find the message** that made the change you don't like
2. **Edit the message** - Change what you asked for
   - Example: Change "Make all buttons red" to "Keep buttons blue"
3. **Or delete it** - Remove that instruction entirely
4. **Lovable will adjust** - It will revert that specific change

### Complete Workflow: Make Mistake → Revert → Iterate

**Real Example:**

#### Step 1: Make a Change
```
Change the homepage layout to a three-column grid
```

**Result:** Layout breaks - columns overlap, content is misaligned

#### Step 2: Identify the Problem
- Layout looks wrong
- Content overlaps
- Mobile view is broken

#### Step 3: Use Chat Mode to Understand
```
The three-column layout I just added looks broken. Can you help me understand what went wrong?
```

**Chat Mode explains:** The grid needs better spacing and responsive breakpoints.

#### Step 4: Revert the Change

**Option A: Use History**
1. Go to History
2. Find version before grid change
3. Click "Revert"
4. Project restored!

**Option B: Ask to Revert**
```
Revert the last change - go back to before I changed the layout to three columns
```

#### Step 5: Try a Better Approach
```
Create a two-column layout with main content on left and sidebar on right. Make sure it's fully responsive and has proper spacing.
```

**Result:** Better layout that works!

#### Step 6: Iterate and Improve
```
The two-column layout works, but can you make the sidebar slightly narrower and add more spacing between columns?
```

**Result:** Perfect layout!

**What You Learned:**
- ✅ Made a mistake (that's okay!)
- ✅ Identified the problem
- ✅ Reverted safely
- ✅ Tried a better approach
- ✅ Iterated to perfection

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Don't be afraid to experiment! You can always revert if something doesn't work out. Reverting is a normal part of development.

## 📖 Lesson 4: Adding New Pages

### Why Add New Pages?

Most websites and apps have multiple pages:
- **Home page** - The main landing page
- **About page** - Information about you/your business
- **Contact page** - Ways to get in touch
- **Product/Service pages** - Details about what you offer
- **Blog pages** - Articles and content

### How to Add a New Page

#### Step 1: Ask Lovable to Add a Page

In Agent Mode or with a prompt, simply ask:

**Simple:**
```
Add an About page
```

**More Detailed:**
```
Create an About page with a hero section, our story, team members, and mission statement
```

**Very Detailed:**
```
Add a new page called "Services" with:
- A header explaining what we offer
- Three service cards with icons
- A call-to-action button
- Link it in the navigation menu
```

#### Step 2: Lovable Creates the Page

Lovable will:
- Create the new page
- Add it to your navigation (usually automatically)
- Style it to match your existing design
- Make it accessible from your site

#### Step 3: Customize the New Page

After the page is created, you can refine it:

```
Update the About page with our actual company story
Add team member photos to the About page
Change the Services page layout to show 4 services instead of 3
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Start with simple pages, then add more detail as you go. You can always improve them later!

## 📖 Lesson 5: Adding Images to Your Project

### Why Add Images?

Images make your website:
- **More engaging** - Visual content is more interesting
- **More professional** - Good images improve credibility
- **More informative** - Show instead of just tell
- **More memorable** - People remember visuals better

### How to Add Images

#### Method 1: Upload Images Directly

1. **Find the "Attach" button** - Usually near the prompt box
2. **Click "Attach"** or the image icon
3. **Select "Upload Image"** or "Choose File"
4. **Pick your image** from your computer
5. **The image uploads** - You'll see it attached

#### Method 2: Add Images in Your Prompt

1. **Upload the image first** (using Method 1)
2. **Then type your prompt:**
   ```
   Use this image as the hero background on the homepage
   ```
   or
   ```
   Add this logo to the header
   ```

#### Method 3: Describe Images You Want

You can ask Lovable to find or create images:

```
Add a hero image - something modern and professional
Use stock photos for the team section
Create an icon for the services section
```

### Best Practices for Images

- **Use high-quality images** - Clear, not blurry
- **Optimize file size** - Large images slow down your site
- **Use appropriate formats** - JPG for photos, PNG for graphics
- **Consider copyright** - Use images you have rights to
- **Add alt text** - Describe images for accessibility

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Start with free stock photo sites like Unsplash or Pexels for high-quality, free images!
