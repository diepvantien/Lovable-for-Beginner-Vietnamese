## 📖 Lesson 1: Starting from a Prompt (The Most Common Way)

### What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is simply the message you send to Lovable describing what you want to build. Think of it like giving instructions to a builder.

### How to Write Your First Prompt

#### Step 1: Think About What You Want

Before you type, think about:
- **What type of app/website?** (portfolio, blog, e-commerce, etc.)
- **What should it do?** (showcase work, sell products, collect emails, etc.)
- **What should it look like?** (modern, colorful, minimal, etc.)

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Don't worry about being perfect! You can always refine and improve your project later.

#### Step 2: Write Your Prompt

Go to the Lovable dashboard and click in the search box. Then type what you want.

**Example Prompts:**

**Simple:**
```
Create a personal portfolio website
```

**More Detailed:**
```
Create a modern portfolio website for a photographer with a gallery section, about page, and contact form. Use a dark theme with elegant typography.
```

**Very Detailed:**
```
Build a restaurant website for "Sunset Bistro" with:
- A hero section showing the restaurant
- Menu page with categories (appetizers, mains, desserts)
- About page telling the restaurant's story
- Contact page with location and hours
- Online reservation form
Use warm colors and elegant design.
```

#### Step 3: Send Your Prompt

1. After typing, press **Enter** or click the send button
2. Wait while Lovable builds your project (usually 10-30 seconds)
3. Your project will appear!

#### Step 4: Review What Was Built

Once your project is created:
- **Look at the preview** on the right side
- **Check if it matches what you wanted**
- **Note what you like and what you'd like to change**

#### Step 5: Refine Your Project

If something isn't quite right, you can ask for changes:

**Examples:**
```
Make the colors brighter
Add a navigation menu at the top
Change the font to something more modern
Add a footer with social media links
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** It's normal to go back and forth a few times to get it perfect. That's part of the process!

## 📖 Lesson 2: Remixing Existing Projects (Learn from Others)

### What is Remixing?

**Remixing** means taking someone else's project and making it your own. It's like using a recipe but changing the ingredients to suit your taste.

### Why Remix?

- **Learn from examples** - See how others built things
- **Save time** - Start from something that already works
- **Get inspiration** - Discover new ideas and designs
- **Understand patterns** - Learn common structures

### How to Remix a Project

#### Step 1: Browse the Community

1. On the Lovable dashboard, scroll down to see **"From the Community"** section
2. You'll see cards showing different projects people have built
3. Click on any project that looks interesting

#### Step 2: Preview the Project

1. Click on a project card
2. You'll see a preview of the project
3. Look around - check out the design, features, and layout

#### Step 3: Remix It

1. If you like what you see, look for a **"Remix"** button (usually in the top right)
2. Click the **"Remix"** button
3. Lovable will create a copy of that project for you!

**What happens:** You now have your own version that you can edit and customize however you want.

#### Step 4: Customize Your Remix

Now make it yours! Try:

```
Change the colors to match my brand
Update all the text with my information
Add my logo
Modify the layout to fit my needs
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Remixing is a great way to learn! Look at how the project is structured, then customize it to understand how it works.

## 📖 Lesson 3: Using Figma Designs (For Designers)

### What is Figma?

**Figma** is a popular design tool where designers create mockups (visual designs) of websites and apps before they're built.

### Why Use Figma with Lovable?

If you or a designer has created a design in Figma, you can turn that design into a working website in minutes!

### How to Use Figma Designs

#### Step 1: Get Your Figma Design

You need:
- A Figma account (free to sign up)
- A design file in Figma
- The ability to share the design

#### Step 2: Share Your Figma Design

1. In Figma, open your design
2. Click the **"Share"** button (usually top right)
3. Copy the share link
4. Make sure the link allows "Anyone with the link can view"

#### Step 3: Use It in Lovable

1. In Lovable, start a new project
2. In the prompt box, type something like:

```
Build this website based on my Figma design: [paste your Figma link here]
```

Or you can:
1. Look for an **"Attach"** button near the prompt box
2. Click it and paste your Figma link
3. Then describe what you want built

#### Step 4: Review and Refine

Lovable will analyze your Figma design and build a working version. You can then ask for adjustments:

```
Make the spacing match the Figma design exactly
Use the exact colors from the design
Match the typography from Figma
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** If you don't have a Figma design, that's okay! You can skip this method and use prompts or templates instead.

## 📖 Lesson 4: Using Sketches (Turn Drawings into Code)

### What is This?

You can upload a **sketch** (a drawing or mockup) of what you want, and Lovable will turn it into a working website!

### What Counts as a Sketch?

- A drawing on paper (take a photo)
- A digital sketch (saved as an image)
- A wireframe (simple layout drawing)
- A mockup (visual design)
- A screenshot of something you like

### How to Use Sketches

#### Step 1: Create or Find Your Sketch

You can:
- Draw something on paper and take a photo
- Create a simple sketch in any drawing app
- Use a screenshot of a website you like
- Find an image online that shows what you want

#### Step 2: Upload Your Sketch

1. In Lovable, look for the **"Attach"** button near the prompt box
2. Click **"Attach"**
3. Select **"Upload Image"** or **"Upload File"**
4. Choose your sketch/image from your computer
5. The image will attach to your prompt

#### Step 3: Describe What You Want

After attaching, type something like:

```
Build a website that looks like this sketch. Make it modern and responsive.
```

Or be more specific:

```
Create a landing page based on this design. Use the layout shown but update the colors to blue and white, and change the text to be about my coffee shop.
```

#### Step 4: Let Lovable Build It

1. Send your prompt with the attached image
2. Lovable will analyze your sketch and build a working version
3. Review and ask for any adjustments

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Even a rough sketch works! Lovable is good at understanding what you mean, even if the drawing isn't perfect.

## 📖 Lesson 5: Cloning Websites (Recreate What You Like)

### What is Cloning?

**Cloning** means recreating an existing website or app. You see a website you like, and you want to build something similar.

### Why Clone?

- **Learn from the best** - See how successful sites are built
- **Save design time** - Start with a proven layout
- **Understand patterns** - Learn what works well
- **Create similar functionality** - Replicate features you like

### How to Clone a Website

#### Step 1: Find a Website You Like

Browse the internet and find a website you'd like to recreate or use as inspiration.

**Examples:**
- A portfolio site you admire
- A landing page with great design
- An app interface you like
- A blog layout that works well

#### Step 2: Take a Screenshot or Get the URL

You can:
- Take a screenshot of the website
- Copy the website's URL (address)
- Describe what you see

#### Step 3: Use It in Lovable

**Option A: With a Screenshot**
1. Attach the screenshot to your prompt
2. Type: `Build a website similar to this design`

**Option B: With a URL**
1. In your prompt, include the URL:
```
Create a website similar to https://example.com but for my business
```

**Option C: With a Description**
```
Build a landing page similar to Apple's website - clean, minimal, with a hero section and product showcase
```

#### Step 4: Customize It

After Lovable builds it, make it yours:

```
Change the colors to match my brand
Update all the content with my information
Modify the layout slightly
Add my logo and branding
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Cloning is great for learning! Study what makes the original site work, then adapt it for your needs.
