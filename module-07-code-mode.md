# Module 7: Code Mode - Viewing and Editing Code Directly

**Goal:** Understand how to work with code when you need to (Optional for beginners)

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Note:** This module is optional for complete beginners. You can build amazing apps without ever touching code! This module is for those who want to understand or customize code directly.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn in This Module

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what Code Mode is
- Know when you might need to view code

## 📖 Lesson 1: What is Code Mode?

### Understanding Code Mode

**Code Mode** lets you view and edit your project's raw code directly in Lovable. It's like opening the hood of a car - you can see and modify how everything works under the surface.

### Important Note for Beginners

> **You don't need Code Mode to build amazing apps!** Lovable is designed so you can build everything using prompts. Code Mode is optional and mainly for:
> - Advanced customization
> - Learning how code works
> - Making precise technical changes
> - Understanding what Lovable built

**💡 Plan Information:** Code editing requires a paid plan, but viewing code is free. You can build everything using prompts on the free plan! See the [Pricing and Plans Guide](supplement-pricing-and-plans.md) for details.

### What You'll See in Code Mode

When you open Code Mode, you'll see:
- **File structure** - All the files in your project
- **Code files** - The actual code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
- **Configuration files** - Settings and configurations
- **Organized folders** - Everything organized logically

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Don't be intimidated by code! Even if you don't understand it, you can still use Lovable effectively with prompts.

## 📖 Lesson 2: When to Use Code Mode vs. Prompts

### Use Prompts When:

✅ **You want to build features** - "Add a contact form"  
✅ **You want to make changes** - "Change the colors to blue"  
✅ **You're learning** - Prompts help you understand  
✅ **You want quick results** - Prompts are faster  
✅ **You're not comfortable with code** - Prompts are easier  

**Prompts are usually the better choice!**

### Use Code Mode When:

✅ **You need precise control** - Exact positioning, specific values  
✅ **You want to learn code** - See how things are built  
✅ **You're debugging** - Find and fix specific issues  
✅ **You need advanced customization** - Things prompts can't do  
✅ **You understand code** - You know what you're looking for  

**Code Mode is for advanced users or learners.**

### The Best Approach

**For beginners:** Use prompts for everything. Only use Code Mode if you're curious about how things work or if a prompt isn't giving you the exact result you need.

**For advanced users:** Use prompts for most things, Code Mode for fine-tuning.

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Start with prompts! You can build entire apps without ever opening Code Mode.

## 📖 Lesson 3: Viewing Your Code

### How to Open Code Mode

#### Step 1: Find Code Mode

1. In your Lovable project, look for a **"Code"** button or tab
2. It might be in the top menu, sidebar, or as a toggle
3. Click it to enter Code Mode

**What you'll see:** Your project's file structure and code files.

#### Step 2: Explore the File Structure

You'll see folders and files organized like:

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Header.jsx
│   │   ├── Footer.jsx
│   │   └── Button.jsx
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Home.jsx
│   │   └── About.jsx
│   └── App.jsx
├── public/
│   └── images/
└── package.json
```

**Don't worry if this looks confusing!** You don't need to understand it to use Lovable.

#### Step 3: Open a File

1. **Click on a file** - It opens in the editor
2. **See the code** - You'll see the actual code
3. **Read it** - Even if you don't understand, you can see what Lovable built

### Understanding What You See

**Common file types:**

- **.jsx or .js** - JavaScript/React code (the logic)
- **.css** - Styling code (how things look)
- **.html** - Structure code (the layout)
- **.json** - Configuration files (settings)

**💡 Beginner Tip:** You don't need to understand the code! Just knowing it exists and that Lovable created it is enough.

## 📖 Lesson 4: Making Code Edits (Paid Plans)

### Important: Code Editing Requires Paid Plan

> **Note:** Viewing code is available on all plans, but **editing code directly requires a paid plan**. You can still make all changes using prompts on the free plan!

**📊 For complete pricing details:** See the [Pricing and Plans Guide](supplement-pricing-and-plans.md) for a full breakdown of what's included in free vs. paid plans.

### How to Edit Code (If You Have Paid Plan)

#### Step 1: Open the File

1. Navigate to the file you want to edit
2. Click on it to open it

#### Step 2: Make Your Changes

1. **Click where you want to edit** - The cursor appears
2. **Type your changes** - Just like editing a document
3. **Save the file** - Usually auto-saves or click Save

#### Step 3: See Your Changes

- Changes appear in the preview
- Your app updates automatically
- You can test immediately

### When Direct Code Edits Help

- **Precise values** - "Change this exact number to 42"
- **Complex logic** - Advanced functionality
- **Quick tweaks** - Small changes faster than prompts
- **Learning** - Understanding how code works

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Even with a paid plan, prompts are usually easier and faster. Use code edits only when you need precise control.

## 📖 Lesson 5: Learning from Code

### Code as a Learning Tool

Even if you don't edit code, **viewing it can teach you a lot!**

### What You Can Learn

1. **How Lovable structures projects** - See the organization
2. **How features are built** - Understand the implementation
3. **Code patterns** - See common approaches
4. **Best practices** - Learn from Lovable's code quality

### Example: Learning from a Button

**You ask Lovable:**
```
Add a blue button that says "Click Me"
```

**Then in Code Mode, you can see:**
- How the button is created
- How the color is applied
- How the text is added
- The structure and style

**This teaches you** how buttons work in code!

### Using Code to Improve Prompts

After viewing code, you might understand:
- What's possible
- How to describe things better
- What to ask for in prompts

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Don't feel pressured to understand code! View it out of curiosity, but stick with prompts for building.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice

### Practice 1: View Your Code

**Task:** Explore your project's code structure

1. **Open Code Mode** - Click the Code button/tab
2. **Browse the files** - Click through different files
3. **Open a component** - Click on a file like "Header.jsx" or "Button.jsx"
4. **Look at the code** - See what Lovable created
5. **Don't worry about understanding** - Just observe!

**What you learned:** Your project has organized code files, even though you built it with prompts!

### Practice 2: Find a Specific Feature

**Task:** Locate code for a feature you built

1. **Think of a feature** - Like "the contact form" or "the navigation menu"
2. **Look for it in Code Mode** - Browse files to find it
3. **Open the file** - See how it's coded
4. **Notice the structure** - See how it's organized

**What you learned:** Every feature you build with prompts has corresponding code!

### Practice 3: Compare Prompt vs. Code (Optional)

**Task:** See how prompts translate to code

1. **Make a change with a prompt:**
   ```
   Change the button color to red
   ```
2. **Open Code Mode** - Find the button file
3. **See the change** - Notice how the code changed
4. **Understand the connection** - Prompts modify code!

**What you learned:** Prompts and code are connected - prompts modify the code for you!
